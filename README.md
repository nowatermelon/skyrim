## Introduction
**Bread** is a complete overhaul modlist for Skyrim AE (1.6.1170) with all DLCs, built around [Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492). It significantly expands content across all aspects (at ~170 esp slots), aiming to breathe lasting vitality into Skyrim while striving to remain lore-friendly.

Additionally, it supports both **English and Chinese**. Although I've found the communities to be quite different, the cultural blending is a fascinating aspect.

## System Requirements

## Installation
1. **Microsoft**
   - [Visual C++ Redistributable latest version x64](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).
   - [.NET latest version x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

2. **Steam**
   - [Disable auto-updates for Skyrim AE](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable).
   - Set game language to English
  
     Note: Even if you want to play the game in Chinese, you still need to complete this step. The Chinese translation is implemented through mods.
   - Upon first launch, Skyrim AE will auto-download the DLCs. Stay on this screen until finished, exit only after it's done.

     Note: If you have DLC problems during installation, delete the game and redo this step.

2. **Wabbajack**
    - ~~Seek the Mad God's shrine. Whisper your madness. Claim your chaos. The Wabbajack awaits.~~
    - Sorry, it's actually [this file](https://www.wabbajack.org). After download, it must go into a folder on drive’s root like `D:\Wabbajack` to avoid errors. Then run `Wabbajack.exe`.
    - Find Bread and click “Download & Install”. Set installation and downloads location (e.g. `D:\Bread` and `D:\Bread\Downloads`). Then Install.

      Note: Nexus Premium gets automatic downloads; otherwise each mod requires a manual click.
