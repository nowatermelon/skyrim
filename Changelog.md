Tips: Any custom files not included in the modlist will be deleted during updates. To keep the mods you've added, you must add the [NoDelete] prefix to their names. With each release, I provide baseline profiles and overwrite files on Nexus. Back up your current saves and overwrite the default one if you want to use them.
