## Wabbajack says something failed to download.
If the files are related to the DLCs, check the [Installation](https://github.com/nowatermelon/skyrim/blob/main/README.md#Installation) part.

Otherwise, manually download the missing files and place them into the `Downloads` folder.

See [Wabbajack Wiki](https://wiki.wabbajack.org/user_documentation/Troubleshooting%20FAQ.html) for detailed information.

 Then go to the `SKSE` folder within it and search for "crash". You'll see files like `crash-2025-11-22-01-56-21.log`.
