### I can't level up or fast travel.
With [Sunhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) enabled, you need to sleep to level up. Additionally, with [Journeyman](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92220), you need to use a travel bag to fast travel.

### Some enemies are too high level.
This is a recommended setting for [Skyvalor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106240). You can search for `SkyPatcher.ini` and change `iEnableUnlevelNPCs=1` to 0 to disable the removal of enemy level caps.

### Wabbajack says something failed to download.
If the files are related to the DLCs, check the [Installation](https://github.com/nowatermelon/skyrim/blob/main/README.md#Installation) part.

Otherwise, manually download the missing files and place them into the `Downloads` folder.

See [Wabbajack Wiki](https://wiki.wabbajack.org/user_documentation/Troubleshooting%20FAQ.html) for detailed information.

### Where are the crash logs?
Open the `My Games` folder.

Then go to the `SKSE` folder within it and search for "crash". You'll see files like `crash-2025-11-22-01-56-21.log`.

### Why is it called bread? I prefer milk.
Actually, it's got nothing to do with bread... It's just a Chinese pun mixing my channel name with the word "modlist".

### Why is the cave so dark?
